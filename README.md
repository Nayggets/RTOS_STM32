# RTOS_STM32
This is an RTOS for STM32 (ARM architecture) 
This is a structure of an RTOS which execute a limited number of simple thread with scheduling, it also have driver and syscall to communicate and do action on the syst√®me.
This Project is still in the early developpment phase.

## History
I started this project to understand why RTOS exists, why embedded systems use them, how they operate, and the differences from traditional operating systems.

## Main TODO:
* [x] Periodic Scheduler
* [x] Round Robin Scheduler
* [x] Time library 
* [x] UART driver 
* [x] Thread switching  
* [x] OSKernel 
* [x] OSKernelStackInit
* [x] Array of thread
* [x] Semaphore
* [x] Syscalls structure
* [ ] Syscalls implementation
* [ ] File system
