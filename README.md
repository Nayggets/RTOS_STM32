This is an RTOS for STM32 (ARM architecture) 
This is a structure of an RTOS which execute a limited number of simple thread with scheduling, it also have driver and syscall to communicate and do action on the syst√®me.
This Project is still in the early developpment phase.

## Main TODO:
* [x] Periodic Scheduler
* [x] Round Robin Scheduler
* [x] Time library 
* [x] UART driver 
* [x] Thread switching
